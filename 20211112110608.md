#20211112110608 I should play with `jq, gron` to process json in shell scripts

The other day I was writing some helper shell script which essentially constructed some form of json from another source of json.
The script is ended up being really messy, and I belive it would have been much easer to write and read if were familiar with tools like `jq, gron` and other json processing shell programs, therefore it would be a greate idea to play with those and in the future use them if I have to deal with json in shell scripts.

Here is the mentioned messy script that I wrote:

```bash

#! /usr/bin/env bash

for dir in packages/ui*; do

  x=$(cat "$dir"/package.json | grep -E "@instructure/[a-z].*:" | awk '{print $1}')

  echo "dir: $dir --------------------"
  echo "\"references\": [" >"$dir/refs.json"
  while IFS=":" read -r line; do
    z="${line##*/}"
    echo "{ \"path\": \"../${z%%\"}/tsconfig.build.json\" }," >>"$dir/refs.json"
  done <<<"$x"

  echo "]" >>"$dir/refs.json"
  echo "--------------------------"
done

```
